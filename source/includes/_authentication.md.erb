# Authentication
<%= partial 'includes/php/authentication' %>
The Cloudbet API uses JSON Web Tokens or [JWTs](https://jwt.io) to allow secure access to the API.

You can register for an API key at our [affiliate portal](https://affiliates.cloudbet.com/en/affiliates/sign_up).

Our API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a HTTP header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: bearer TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>TOKEN</code> with your personal API key.
